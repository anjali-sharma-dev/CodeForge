# DSA Study Roadmap


**Project type:** Data Structures & Algorithms study platform / curated practice roadmap  


---

## Overview

**DSA Study Roadmap** is a curated, structured platform for practicing Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).  
It combines a progressive checklist of topics, categorized problem lists, and suggested practice paths to help prepare for technical interviews and strengthen algorithmic thinking.

This project is designed to demonstrate practical skills in:  
- Data structures & algorithms (arrays, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, etc.)  
- Web development (React/Next.js + Node/Express or similar)  
- TypeScript, testing, CI/CD and deployment  
- UX for study/learning tools and analytics (progress tracking)
